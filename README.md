# Medical-Symptoms-Text-and-Audio-Classification
I stumbled across an interesting dataset containing verbal descriptions of medical symptoms (.wav, audio data) paired with text transcriptions (.csv, text data) and labeled according to the category of the ailment. I have never worked with audio data before and so I decided to explore this dataset.

Medical symptoms text and audio classification involves using machine learning to analyze patient-reported symptoms in both text and audio formats. Models are trained to recognize patterns, enabling accurate classification of symptoms for potential diagnoses.
